Android project

Peer-to-peer Pick-up and delivery system can connect a person who is travelling from a place to another, wishing to deliver a parcel on the route of travel, to a person who is willing to send a parcel on this path during this specific time frame. This same service can be extended to use for multiple similar use cases like parcel service, carpooling service, all-in-one delivery service etc.
